{"name":"net-tcp-fec","tagline":"Modifications to the Linux networking stack to enable forward error correction in TCP","body":"This repository hosts modifications to the Linux kernel to enable forward error correction (FEC) in TCP.\r\nThe technique is described as the \"Corrective\" approach in our SIGCOMM 2013 publication titled [\"Reducing Web Latency: The Virtue of Gentle Aggression\"](http://research.google.com/pubs/pub41217.html).\r\n\r\nThe modifications were originally developed for the Linux kernel version 2.6.34 and have since been rebased to version 3.10 - though without extensive testing!\r\n\r\nWe invite you to play around with the patches and welcome your feedback. We are also happy to apply bugfixes and future rebases you might have to the existing patch set.\r\n\r\nWARNING: Since the modifications have not been tested extensively in the current kernel version, we advise you to execute tests in an isolated environment with an option for a recovery from kernel panics, etc.\r\n\r\n### Patch components\r\n\r\nThe changes are grouped into three patches building on top of each other: Common, Receiver, and Sender.\r\nFor a detailed description of the parts implemented by each patch please check the description at the top of each patch file.\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\n\r\nTo get started fetch the Linux kernel version used as the base for the patch set (here version 3.10):\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ git clone git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git\r\n$ cd linux\r\n$ git checkout tags/v3.10\r\n```\r\n\r\nNext, check out the patches (or download them directly). Then apply them in the right order (Common, then Receiver, then Sender):\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ git apply <local path to patches>/0001-net-tcp-TCP-with-Forward-Error-Correction-Common.patch\r\n$ git apply <local path to patches>/0002-net-tcp-TCP-with-Forward-Error-Correction-Receiver.patch\r\n$ git apply <local path to patches>/0003-net-tcp-TCP-with-Forward-Error-Correction-Sender.patch\r\n```\r\n\r\nAll three `apply` calls do NOT produce any console output if applied correctly.\r\n\r\nNOTE: If you want to apply the patches to a different kernel version, keep in mind that the apply step can fail if some changes are conflicted with the changed code base. A possible solution is to apply a patch partially (using the `--reject` flag when running `git apply`) and then resolve the conflicts stored in `.rej` files manually.\r\n\r\nFinally, you need to compile and install the modified kernel. There are many tutorials on how to do this out there, so we avoid replicating instructions for this here.\r\n\r\nThe FEC feature is turned off by default in an environment running with a modified kernel. To enable it run:\r\n```\r\nsysctl net.ipv4.tcp_fec=1\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\nWe developed a set of [packetdrill](https://code.google.com/p/packetdrill/) test routines to check the proper functionality of the FEC engine. We will publish them in this repository soon.\r\n\r\nIf you have further questions, feel free to contact any of the contributors.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
